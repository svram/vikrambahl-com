While studying computer graphics at NTU, I created this guitar app along with my colleague [Vasu][1]. We used Adobe Flash 3.0 to quickly prototype the strings and the body of the guitar. Then by using keyframe animation and keyboard event triggering, added sounds and a vibration to the strings. 

_Since flash has been deprecated on modern browsers, you can't interact with the simulation anymore. It's on my backlog to port it to html5 canvas_

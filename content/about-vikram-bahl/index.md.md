I've been working in tech for the past 10+ years and I enjoy building software. I started out building web and mobile apps. These days I do that AND enjoy building, architecting highly scalable and resilient systems on the cloud. I work as a Customer Engineer at Google in Singapore, spending my time working with some of the largest unicorns and enterprises in Asia. Am happy to talk about tech and cloud anytime.

Gave a talk on audio signal processing with python at [PyCon Singapore][1] 2013. Â I started using python to quickly prototype a beat recognition system for my masters dissertation. I realised the power of python in signal processing. The speed at which you can test algorithms is astounding. You can perform a cross FFT on the IDLE interpreter within seconds. Well, what I found was this nifty dsp library called [pyo][2] which lets you play around with audio signals&#8230;cool results follow. See the video:

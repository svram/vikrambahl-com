This application was the first one I created while learning computer graphics at [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). It parses a .m file, which is nothing but a bunch of numbers representing vertices (x, y, z) in the 3D plane. The resulting 3D model is displayed in the viewport. Options for orthogonal/perspective projection along with various viewing options to pan, zoom and rotate the model were provided. Plane, spherical and psychedelic texturing options were implemented.
